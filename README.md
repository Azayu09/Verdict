# Verdict

A logic-driven web application that evaluates user goals based on current behavior, probability, and realistic constraints instead of motivation or positivity.

---

## Overview

Verdict is designed to answer one question honestly:

**“If I continue exactly as I am right now, what is the most likely outcome of this goal?”**

The application avoids encouragement, inspiration, or emotional validation.  
It focuses purely on logical projection using predefined rules and assumptions.

---

## Problem Statement

Most goal-tracking or self-improvement platforms reinforce optimism bias.  
They encourage users without accounting for effort gaps, inconsistency, or statistical likelihood.

This project intentionally removes motivational language and replaces it with:
- probability ranges
- effort-to-outcome mapping
- consequence-based reasoning

---

## Key Features

- Goal input with effort, time, and consistency parameters  
- Rule-based outcome evaluation  
- Probability ranges instead of binary success/failure  
- Minimal UI focused on clarity, not gamification  
- No emotional reinforcement or encouragement logic  

---

## How It Works

1. Users define a goal and their current behavior
2. The system applies predefined logical rules
3. Outcomes are calculated based on:
   - effort consistency
   - time horizon
   - known human behavior patterns
4. The result reflects the **most likely outcome** if no changes are made

The logic is deterministic and transparent, not model-based or predictive AI.
